A typical node, like BCS, when starting-up (on load of a board for first time, or entire project)
will have set() run on each property. So for BCS, it's texture, brightness, contrast, saturation.
Hence the work func will run FOUR TIMES...
This is kind of inevitable, or is it?

Can I queue them up and then fire one work func?
